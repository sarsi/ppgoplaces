	<p><b>Tips On Using Location Services</b>
	<br>The information provided here is base upon experiences using Android<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> location services, 
	and is by no means representative of the functionality and usability of location services. The experience shared here is intends to 
	help improve user experience of using this application.</p>
	
	<p><u>Some Technical Jargons</u>
	<br><b>Global Positioning System</b>
	<br>Global Position System, a.k.a. GPS, is a space-based satellite navigation system 
	that provides location and time information in all weather, anywhere on or near the Earth, 
	where there is an <b><u>unobstructed line of sight</b></u> to four or more GPS satellites. 
		
	<p><b>Cell Tower</b>
	<br>Mobile phone cellular towers, a.k.a Cell-Towers, are radio transmitters and receivers that let the tower
	communicates with the user mobile phone. If the cellular phone is out of coverage, i.e. it is not able to communicate
	to any cell tower nearby or none in the vicinity. In the context of this discussion, we will refer to network
	as Wifi Access Point not to confuse with Cell-Tower, which will refers here as cell tower.</p>
	
	<p><b>WiFi Tower</b>
	<br>Wireless LAN, often refers to as Access Point (AP) at home or at work, and <q>Mobile Hotspots</q> when outdoor , such in restaurants
	or in the shopping malls.</p>
	
	<p><b>How To Get A Good Location Fix.</b>.
	<p>GPS, WiFi and Cell-Towers can each provides clue of the device location,  i.e. the latitude and longitude information. The 
	trade off are usually the discovery time, accuracy and battery life. </p>
	
	<p>Of the three, GPS is the most accurate but it needs an <q><b><u>unobstructed line of sight</b></u></q> to work, i.e. gps may only operates outdoor. </p>
	
	<p>The other method, is a collective use of WiFi and Cell-Towers, however, the accuracy is base on the proximity to the nearest accesspoint or cell-tower. 
	More often to get a quick location fix is via using cell tower instead of GPS, however it may return a less accurate fix. To turn on WiFi, even the device is not sign 
	on to any network, will helps speed up location search.</p>
	
	<p><a name="indoor"><b>Indoor</b>
	<br>Turn OFF <q>GPS</q> when indoor to preserve batter life, GPS can only operate outdoor with a
	clear line of sight to the orbiting satellites. Turn ON WiFi, to helps enhance the location search.</p>
	
	<p><a name="outdoor"><b>Outdoor</b>
	<br>In open field or country side, turn ON GPS. You may turn OFF WiFi to preserve battery life unless there are mobile hotspots in the vicinity.   
	Notes: GPS takes an usual long duration to get the first location lock. However, once a location fix is obtained, the subsequent search is relatively faster.</p>
	
	<p>If you are in down town or busy city streets with lot of trees and tall buildings, it may
	be difficult to get a lock on the GPS, try turning On WiFi it may help speed up location search.</p>
	
	<p>If <q>Find Location - Accuracy High&#47;Slow</q>, if <q>Outdoor</q> is selected, the application will prompt you to turn on GPS 
	if it is not already turned on.</q>

	<p><q>Stop Location Updates</q> when no longer required location&#47;address updates to preserve battery life.</p>
	
	<p>I would really appreciate any feedback or correction to the above information. THANK YOU</p>
